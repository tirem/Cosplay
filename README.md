## Overview

This addon allows you to copy the look of any player you are targeting!


## Installation
* Download the latest release of Cosplay from the panel on the right and extract it.
* Open up the extracted folder and inside of it will be a directory called `addons`.
* Copy the addons folder to your `Ashita` folder, merging it with your current `Ashita/addons` folder.
* To load Cosplay, type `/addon load Cosplay` in your chatbox.
* If you want to load this addon by default:
    * Open up the file `default.txt` in the `Ashita/scripts` folder.
    * Add the following line: `/addon load Cosplay`
* **NOTE:** You must follow these steps to install the addon. Downloading the code directly will not work without source control software as this repository makes use of git submodules!

## Config

To see the help printout for command type `/cosplay help`, or `/cos help` into the chatbox and commands will be listed in chat.

Type `/cos` or `/cosplay` with another player selected and you will cosplay as them! (You will look like you're wearing their gear on your screen only.)

Type `/cos off` or `/cos clear` to return to your normal look!

As of right now cosplays aren't saved but that may be a feature I add in the future if it is requested.
