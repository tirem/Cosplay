## Overview

This addon allows you to copy the look of any player you are targeting!

## Installation
* Download the repository from the button above
* Copy the `Cosplay` folder inside the repository into your `Ashita/addons` folder
* Ensure the `Cosplay` folder directly contains `cosplay.lua`
* To load Cosplay, type `/addon load Cosplay` in your chatbox.
* If you want to load this addon by default:
    * Open up the file `default.txt` in the `Ashita/scripts` folder.
    * Add the following line: `/addon load Cosplay`

## Config

To see the help printout for commands type `/cosplay help`, or `/cos help` into the chatbox and commands will be listed in chat.

Type `/cos` or `/cosplay` with another player selected and you will cosplay as them! (You will look like you're wearing their gear on your screen only)

Type `/cos off` or `/cos clear` to return to your normal look!

As of right now cosplays aren't saved but that may be a feature I add in the future if it is requested.

## Thank You!

This addon was inspired by the sexchange addon so a thank you to the creator of the sexchange addon and Ashita v4 as a whole: **atom0s**
